Indian Sign Language (ISL) Recognition

Sign Languages are used all over the world by the deaf communities. It emphasizes the movement of hands, arms, head and body in a conceptual predetermined way so that a gesture language would be constructed significantly. Indian Sign Language (ISL) is a dynamic sign language. In this project we have used Histogram Orientation to recognise different sign languages.
